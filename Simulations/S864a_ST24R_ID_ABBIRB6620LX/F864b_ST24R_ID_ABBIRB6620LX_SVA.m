%% Function "F864b_ST24R_ID_ABBIRB6620LX_SVA" - Spatial Vector Algebra.
% ABB IRB 910SC - Robot HOME TOOL Up.
% Function solves INVERSE DYNAMICS with CONTROL, which
% takes into account a feedback for POSITION and VELOCITY.
%
% It is necessary to calculate de JOINTS magnitudes (position),
% to implement the INVERSE DYNAMICS algorithm.
% To do so, we use the DIFFERENTIAL KINEMATICS algorithm with the
% GEOMETRIC JACOBIAN (inverse) and the Tool Velocities, to define the
% joint trajectory target (i.e., position, velocity and acceleration).
% Then the SVA (Spatial Vector Algebra) is used implementing the
% RNEA Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm with use of POE for kinematics.

% function TorOut = F864b_ST24R_ID_ABBIRB6620LX_SVA(u)
%
% INPUTS: "u" (1x20) = are composed by the following vectors.
% "traXYZ" (1..3) = translations for the TcP (noap - "p" goal) in S frame.
% "rotXYZ" (4..6) = rotations for Tool (noap - "noa" (X+Y+Z)) in S frame.
% "Solutions" (7) =  sending the robot Home (0) or track the target (1)
% "Safety" (8) = Stop de robot (0) or On (1) to track the target 
% "JointVAL"(9..14) = TheVAL Feedback of actual joints POSITIONS rad.
% "JointpVAL"(15..20) = ThepVAL Feedback actual joints VELOCITIES rad/sec
%
% OUTPUTS:
% "TorOut" (t1..t6) are the TORQUES solution for the Robot Joints1..6.
%
% The SIMSCAPE MULTIBODY SYSTEM used to build the Digital-Twin of the robot
% does not support direxcty Screw Theory and is still based on the DH
% formalism. For this reason, the revolute joints only can rotate on "Z"
% axis. Therefore, to construct the manipulator body we must use the
% Denavit-Hartenberg parameters (in this case the Classical DH - "DHC").
% Afterwards, Screw Theory POE is used to perform forward kinematics.
% For this robot the DHC parameters are:
